          <h3>How to Make Meatballs Recipe?</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Let's take our mince into a suitable mixing bowl. Let's take the grated and squeezed onion, small cut garlic, egg, breadcrumbs, vegetable oil, parsley, salt, pepper, and cumin and knead until the ingredients are well mixed.</li>
            <li>Let's cover the dough we prepared with cling and let it rest in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>At the end of the time, let's take our mortar from the cupboard and shape it by tearing off pieces with our hands. I made the shape oval, but you can shape it as you wish. However, you should pay attention to the fact that your meatballs are thin so that the insides are cooked.</li>
            <li>Let's take our meatballs that we have shaped into a suitable plate. If you wish, you can rest your meatballs at this stage.</li>
            <li>To cook our meatballs, let's take oil in our pan on the stove and heat it.</li>
            <li>Then, let's take our meatballs to our pan and cook them by turning both sides.</li>
            <li>Let's take the cooked meatballs to a plate on which we lay paper towels to drain the excess oil and serve. Enjoy your meal.</li>
